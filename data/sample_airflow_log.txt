# Sample Airflow Log: Failed Job Due to PRODX Update
# Business Context: Tenant job for Group-Ingestion fails after capability team update to PRODX v2.3, 
# due to unvalidated change in Glue dependency affecting schema evolution. 
# This simulates the pain point of surprise failures in non-prod environments.
